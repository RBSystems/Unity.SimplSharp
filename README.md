# Unity.SimplSharp
## Part of the open source Unity.Framework for Crestron

Crestron SIMPL# library with miscelaneous useful classes, generics, and extensions.

## License: Commercial Use Permitted (LGPL V3). In brief, under this license:
Please freely use this module in any Crestron application, including for-profit Crestron SIMPL Windows programs that you charge money to sell, and in SIMPL# libraries of your own, including ones you sell.

* You may freely use it as a referenced external library (just like you would use Newtonsoft/JSON.Net--this is called dynamic linking). This use does NOT require you to license your code as LPGL V3 or open source either your SIMPL Windows programs or your SIMPL# libraries.
* However (and there's no need to do thisâ€”and it's not recommended), if instead of linking to this as an external library (referencing the .dll or project in Visual Studio), you copy code from this library into your SIMPL# library (e.g. copy the .cs files into your project), then your entire library must be open sourced and licensed as LGPL V3 as well.

These two rules keep a clean separation between your private code, and this public library. Referencing the .dll / project (modified or unmodified) enables you to maintain your own code under any license you wish including keeping it private or closed source, while keeping the Unity project open source and freely available.

* If you make changes to the UnityExcelXml source (which you are free to modify in any way to make it more useful to you), those changes needs to be licensed as LGPL V3 as well and remain open source and publically available.
* Branching this reposity, and issuing a pull request back to this repository would be appreciated if you feel those changes will enhance the usability of this library to other Crestron programmers.
